# C - Variables, if, else, while

This project contains tasks for learning about variables and control structures in C.

## Tasks

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing:** Write a program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
    - The output of the program should be:
        - The number, followed by
        - `is positive`, if the number is greater than 0
        - `is zero`, if the number is 0
        - `is negative`, if the number is less than 0
        - followed by a new line
2. **The last digit:** Write a program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
    - The output of the program should be:
        - The string `Last digit of`, followed by `n`, followed by
        - `is`, followed by
        - if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
        - if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
        - if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
        - followed by a new line
3. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    - You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc.) is forbidden).
    - All your code should be in the `main` function.
    - You can only use `putchar` twice in your code.
4. **alphABET:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
    - You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc.) is forbidden).
    - All your code should be in the `main` function.
    - You can only use `putchar` three times in your code.
5. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    - Print all letters except for `q` and `e`.
    - You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc.) is forbidden).
    - All your code should be in the `main` function.
    - You can only use `putchar` twice in your code.
6. **Numbers:** Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
    - All your code should be in the main function.
7. **Numberz:** Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
    - You are not allowed to use any variable of type char.
    - You can only use the putchar function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc.) is forbidden).
    - You can only use putchar twice in your code.
    - All your code should be in the main function.
8. **Smile in the mirror:** Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
    - You can only use the putchar function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc.) is forbidden).
    - All your code should be in the main function.
    - You can only use putchar twice in your code.
9. **Hexadecimal:** Write a program that prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    - You can only use the putchar function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc.) is forbidden).
    - All your code should be in the main function.
    - You can only use putchar three times in your code.
