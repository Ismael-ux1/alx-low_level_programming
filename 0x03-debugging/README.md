# C - Debugging

This project contains tasks for learning about debugging in C.

## Tasks

0. **Multiple mains:** Based on the `main.c` file above, create a file named `0-main.c`. This file must test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
    - You are not coding the solution/function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from `0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0` to compile with this main file to test locally.
    - You only need to upload `0-main.c` and `main.h` for this task. We will provide our own `positive_or_negative()` function.
1. **Like, comment, subscribe:** Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
    - Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
2. **0 > 972?:** This program prints the largest of three integers. Fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3. **Leap year:** This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
    - Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
